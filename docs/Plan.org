* What I would like to do with Olifant and the things I learned [0/8]

- [ ] Compile a series of expressions, where last one is main
- [ ] Define single argument lambdas
- [ ] Call lambda
- [ ] Define global variables
- [ ] Add numeric and boolean types

  Experiment with a literal type and see how that goes

  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  -- | Literal values in the language
  data Lit = LInt Int | LBool Bool
        deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)
  #+END_SRC

- [ ] Add a proper symbol table
- [ ] Add error checks and validation

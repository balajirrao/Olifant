** Why do I even need symbol tables?

One of the dumb questions that went through my head a few days ago was the whole
point of the symbol table. These are the simple reasons I need one.

1. Disambiguate b/w values and functions. Even though they are the same at the
   language level; they differ quite lot when the code is generated.
2. Type checks
3. Detect undefined variables
4. Detect free variables and lambda lift them

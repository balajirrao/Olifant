#+TITLE: Issues

* OP load, store and alloca
  When do I need them? What are things LLVM local variables can't do?

* Compile named local variables without alloc/store and load
  I'm not sure the interface exposed by step is a good enough to do this.

* Change type of GenState.currentBlock from String to Block?

* Remove containers

* Remove default instances of block/gen state if possible. Undefined is ugly

* Why do I even need a symbol table ?
